Development Log

[5/26] Tami - I moved everything to Processing and added the set methods for each car part.  
[5/26] Sadid - I created and wrote the CarParts class as well as all the individual classes for the car parts.   

[5/28] Tami - I added the Button class for use in views.

[5/29] Tami - I added a Label class and created the Home page. I finished writing the most of the Upgrades view and began work on the Race view, and I also worked on some calculations for moving the Car.   
[5/29] Sadid - I added the background for the Race class and worked on the lights for the race. I made a Start button to make the lights count down. 

[5/30] Tami - I created the Liveries view and made new car liveries. I also made the ImageButton class for buttons with images.   
[5/30] Sadid - I set up both cars for the drag race. They automatically race as soon as the light turns green and their drag times are displayed.  

[6/1] Tami - I made fonts/images load the minimum amount of times necessary. I began working the Weather and WeatherDelegate classes.   
[6/1] Sadid - I rewrote the code for the drag times using millis() instead of frames. I also made the cars stop at the finish line and created a reset button.
