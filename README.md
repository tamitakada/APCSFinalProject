Development Log

[5/26] Tami - I moved everything to Processing and added the set methods for each car part.  
[5/26] Sadid - I created and wrote the CarParts class as well as all the individual classes for the car parts.   

[5/28] Tami - I added the Button class for use in views.

[5/29] Tami - I added a Label class and created the Home page. I also updated the Upgrades view with labels, images, increment/decrement buttons to change the levels of the car parts, and a back button, and I linked it to the Home page menu button. I added the base functions for the Race view and worked on some calculations for moving the Car.
